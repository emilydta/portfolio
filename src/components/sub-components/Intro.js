            My interests span a diverse range, but coding, music, and art, are my primary pursuits. Each of these areas allow me to express myself and my creativity.

            When it comes to coding, I thoroughly enjoy the process of problem-solving and building useful and aesthetically appealing applications.

        <p className='about-paragraph'>
            When I'm not coding, I'm typically preoccupied with creating music or art. Whether I'm making my own tunes or sketching a new character design, it's always a blast. This creative fusion gives me the opportunity to bring my ideas to life in ways that are both functional and visually exciting.
